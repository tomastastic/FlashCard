# FlashCard



## Description
The goal of the FlashCard project is to create a website for reviewing flashcards to practice Japanese Kanji. The flashcards, which include kanji, vocabulary, and radicals, are stored in a MySQL database. Users can access these flashcards to enhance their learning experience.

## Development Roadmap

The development of this project is divided into several stages:

1. **Data Processing**: The project started by taking an existing database and processing the data for importing into MySQL. The code for this step can be found in the `Data Processing` folder.

2. **API Development**: Currently, an API is being developed to access the MySQL database, following a microservices style. The code for this step can be found in the `my-fastapi-app` folder.

3. **Website Development**: A website that will present the data and interact with the user is also in progress. The code for this step can be found in the `Flaskapp` folder.
